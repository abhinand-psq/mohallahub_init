1)change errorhandler page
2)logger is not configured
3)upload can be improved (middleware/uploder)
4)env
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
const ACCESS_EXP = process.env.JWT_EXPIRES_IN || "15m";
const REFRESH_DAYS = parseInt(process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_DAYS || "7"


5) change in // src/controllers/auth.controller.js   uca id 

6) or you can use next() in catch field to wrap with a error function 
7) token password 

8) Note: updateProfile contains TODOs where cloudinary upload integration can be added if you want to accept images in profile update. We added full image handling in signup; update can reuse same pattern. (// src/controllers/user.controller.js)

9) Make sure these imports appear near the top after app is created and before app.use(errorHandler).

10)Admin seed script (optional helper)

11) refreshtoken model is available to add ,delete token with token and user fields

12) refresh token is currently a random token formate change it to jwt.sign from crypt.randombyte

13) random byte or random string always need a expirey attach with it to find its limit


current = 
i changed random token creation to jwt verify for refresh token
in refresh page use jwt.verify to verification the jwt 
dont need a token model instead added refresh token to user model adding value to refresh field in user and remove it .
 verifyAccessToken to verify the token in refresh
and there is no status feild in user model
